# Reverse proxy deployment

TS6 Manager can run behind a reverse proxy such as the one managed by Coolify.

## Coolify starting point

Use [`docker-compose.coolify.yml`](../docker-compose.coolify.yml) as the deployment starting point.

Compared with the standard compose file:

- public `ports` mappings are omitted;
- the reverse proxy should route the public domain to the **frontend** service on port 80; and
- internal backend/sidecar communication remains on Docker networks.

## TeamSpeak on another Docker network

If the TeamSpeak server is reachable through a different Docker network, attach the backend to both networks.

~~~yaml
services:
  backend:
    networks:
      - ts6-network
      - ts-server-net

networks:
  ts-server-net:
    external: true
    name: your-ts-server-network-id
~~~

Do not publish the media sidecar merely to make cross-container routing easier. Join the required Docker network instead.

## Frontend origin

Set `FRONTEND_URL` to the public frontend origin when it differs from the default. This is used for CORS policy.

## WebSockets

The application uses authenticated WebSockets. Ensure the reverse proxy supports WebSocket upgrade requests to the backend through the frontend/nginx path used by your deployment.

## TLS

Terminate HTTPS at the reverse proxy unless you have a different deliberate architecture. Keep TeamSpeak Query and sidecar management endpoints restricted to trusted/internal networks.
